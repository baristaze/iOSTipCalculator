- I spent 8 hours to finish this project.
- I finished below stories:
  . Enter bill amount in a simpler way
    I introduced something more convenient instead of built-in keyboard view.
  . Enter tip rate via a Slider
    Slider has stop points (0%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%); 
    i.e. you don't get 44%, which doesn't make sense.
    Slider animates automatically between points.
  . View bill, tip rate, tip amount, geand total.
  . Two page app (read below)
  * I didn't use storyboard as I don't like .NIB files either. 
    I like to see all logic & design in my code files. 
    Therefore view implementations are kinda custom.
  * I skipped to watch the Swift version of TipCalculator (was not intentional)
    Therefore, my UI might look somehow different what instructor has done.
