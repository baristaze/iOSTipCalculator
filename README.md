- I spent 8 hours to finish this project.
- I finished below stories:
  . Enter bill amount in a simpler way
    I introduced something more convenient instead of built-in keyboard view.
  . Enter tip rate via a Slider
    Slider has stop points (0%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%); 
    i.e. you don't get 44%, which doesn't make sense.
    Slider animates automatically between points.
  . View bill, tip rate, tip amount, geand total.
  . Two page app.
